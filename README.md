# Roborock Vacuum Map Card

A Roborock-native Home Assistant Dashboard card for selecting multiple rooms and launching app-style Roborock cleaning jobs.

![Desktop job configuration](docs/screenshots/demo-desktop.png)

## Features

- Calibrated Roborock maps with zoom, pan, accessible SVG room overlays, and room labels
- Multiple room selection followed by an explicit **Configure job** step
- Configurable **Entire floor** membership, including excluded-but-individually-selectable rooms
- Roborock-style SmartPlan, Vac followed by Mop, Vac & Mop, and Vacuum mode tabs
- App-facing suction, water-flow, cleaning-count, and route controls; internal Roborock modes are filtered out
- Live capability detection for fan speeds, mop routes, mop intensity, transport controls, and floor options
- Dock-aware mop washing/drying status with formatted drying time remaining
- App-style dock panel for Empty, Wash, Dry, wash frequency/mode/temperature, auto-empty, empty mode, auto-drying, drying duration, and child lock
- Confirmation gates before every noisy dock start/drain action, with persistent HA helper-backed setting state
- Atomic SmartPlan control of suction, water, and route, plus native one-pass/two-pass cleaning
- Draft-only settings until Start is pressed; service failures abort before cleaning and retain the draft
- Visual Lovelace editor with room discovery, HA-area mapping, floor/preset reordering, and lossless YAML round-tripping
- Responsive mobile bottom sheet, desktop dialog, light/dark HA themes, keyboard support, English, and Dutch
- One HACS-installable JavaScript bundle
- Optional assisted-carry workflow for a floor without its dock, with durable HA-backed progress across phone reloads

## Requirements

- Home Assistant 2026.3 or newer for native `vacuum.clean_area`
- The official Roborock integration with map segments mapped to Home Assistant areas
- [Roborock Custom Map](https://github.com/Python-roborock/RoborockCustomMap) for an image entity containing `rooms` and `calibration_points`
- HACS is recommended for installation

The card never guesses room hitboxes. A missing custom-map image, room metadata, or calibration produces a prerequisite error.

## Install with HACS

1. In HACS, open the three-dot menu and choose **Custom repositories**.
2. Add `https://github.com/domidyon/roborock-vacuum-map-card` as a **Dashboard** repository.
3. Install **Roborock Vacuum Map Card**.
4. Refresh the browser when HACS asks.
5. Add a card and choose **Roborock Vacuum Map Card** in the visual editor.

Manual installation is also possible: download `roborock-vacuum-map-card.js` from the latest release, place it under `/config/www/`, and register it as a JavaScript module in Settings → Dashboards → Resources.

## Visual editor setup

The editor supports the complete setup without hand-written YAML:

1. Select the vacuum and optional status/settings entities.
2. Add each floor and select its Roborock Custom Map image.
3. The editor discovers segments from the image entity's `rooms` attribute.
4. Map each segment to a Home Assistant area, then set its label, icon, and **Include in Entire floor** value.
5. Add optional presets and select a default.

If areas are missing, configure segment-to-area mapping in the Roborock vacuum entity settings first.

For Roborock multi-level homes, enable **Multi-level** and **Manual Selection** in
the Roborock app. Smart Recognition can override Home Assistant's selected map
or localize against the wrong floor. The card reasserts and verifies the
configured `map_select_option` immediately before every cleaning command.

## Service behavior

Start validates every requested option against live entity options. It then:

1. Selects and confirms the target floor when necessary.
2. Applies the Home Assistant 2026.8+ high-level `cleaning_mode` for Vacuum or Vac & Mop when configured. On HA 2026.7 and older, the explicit fallback uses one atomic `set_clean_motor_mode` command for Vacuum mode.
3. Applies only the app-supported manual route, water-flow, and suction values selected in the sheet.
4. Sets the robot's native cleaning count with `set_clean_repeat_times` using the device-required `{ repeat: 1|2 }` object.
5. Starts one native whole-map job with `vacuum.start` when every configured
   room is selected. Partial or exclusion-based jobs use one
   `vacuum.clean_area` call with the selected HA area IDs.

Vac followed by Mop presses the active floor's `floor.vacuum_then_mop_routine`. It is always treated as a whole-floor job, and the card deliberately hides suction, water flow, cleaning count, and route because those settings belong to the saved Roborock routine. If a floor has no native routine configured, the older `entities.vacuum_then_mop_script` two-phase orchestration remains available as a compatibility fallback.

A complete, commented starting point is provided in [`docs/vacuum-then-mop-script.yaml`](docs/vacuum-then-mop-script.yaml). Replace its five Roborock entity IDs with your own, create or import the script, and select that script in the card editor.

SmartPlan atomically sets Roborock's complete AI bundle (`fan_power: 110`, `water_box_mode: 209`, `mop_mode: 306`) and does not send manual overrides. An Entire-floor selection that excludes configured rooms stays on `vacuum.clean_area`; only a true all-room selection uses `vacuum.start`.

Assisted carry is designed for a saved floor that has no dock and exposes the same four app-style modes. The compact `input_text` payload persists rooms, strategy, cleaning type, and applicable manual settings, while old payloads decode as Vac & Mop. Vacuum-only skips mop hardware checks, pre-wetting, manual mop settings, washing, and drying. SmartPlan uses its atomic AI bundle and conservatively prepares/services the mop. A floor-native Vac followed by Mop routine is stored without manual overrides and launched by the assisted start script after the carry handoff. The scripts and stage helper remain the durable source of truth if the dashboard closes.

Pause, resume, stop, and dock use `vacuum.pause`, `vacuum.start`, `vacuum.stop`, and `vacuum.return_to_base`. `vacuum.start` is exposed only as Resume while paused. Stop and Dock also cancel the configured Vac followed by Mop script and any active assisted upstairs start script before controlling the vacuum.

Dock settings use `vacuum.send_command` with the device-native Roborock payload and update the configured HA helper only after the device accepts the command. This avoids displaying a successful value after a rejected setting. The helpers are optional; without them, the panel uses the documented defaults for its initial display. Empty, Wash, Dry, and Drain are deliberately separate from settings and always require confirmation before starting. The dryer setting command cannot start the dryer; the guarded Dry action uses the distinct dryer-status command.

The onboard dirty-water drain is shown as unavailable because the current Python Roborock transport rewrites the command's required empty-object payload as an empty list. Use the Roborock app for this maintenance action until the upstream transport preserves `{}`.

## Troubleshooting

- **Calibration/rooms missing:** confirm the selected image comes from `roborock_custom_map`, then reload that integration after the core Roborock integration is loaded.
- **Room disabled:** assign an HA `area_id` in the visual editor and make sure that segment is mapped in Roborock entity settings.
- **Preset unavailable:** its fan speed, mop mode, or intensity is absent from the live entity options. Use a supported value or another preset.
- **Vacuum only is unavailable:** configure the Roborock high-level Cleaning mode select on Home Assistant 2026.8+, or set `vacuum_mode_fallback: set_clean_motor_mode` on older stable releases. The fallback is atomic and does not call the incompatible mop-intensity `off` select.
- **Vac followed by Mop is unavailable:** configure `floor.vacuum_then_mop_routine`; for legacy two-phase orchestration, configure `entities.vacuum_then_mop_script` and a Cleaning mode entity that offers both `vacuum` and `mop`.
- **Floor timeout:** verify `map_select_option` exactly matches a live option on `entities.map_select`.
- **Card not found after install:** hard-refresh the browser and verify the HACS resource is loaded as a JavaScript module.
- **Cleaning does not start:** the error toast names the failed operation. The card deliberately does not fall back or roll back device settings automatically.
